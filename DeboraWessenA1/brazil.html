                        <p class="aboutBeaches">Porto de Galinhas is a beach in the municipality of Ipojuca, Pernambuco, Brazil. 
                            Porto de Galinhas is a major tourist destination. The beach is famous for its bright-water 
                            beaches and the natural pools. It is part of the municipality of Ipojuca, and located 60 kilometers 
                            (37 mi) south of the state capital, Recife. The municipality of Ipojuca, where Porto de Galinhas lies, 
                            was established on November 12, 1895.</p>
                        <h3 class="subTitleItem">Origin of name</h3>
                        <p class="aboutBeaches">According to history the town was called Porto Rico (Rich Port) until 1850 when it became a place 
                            where people traded slaves to work in the plantations of sugar cane. To evade the control of the 
                            illegal transaction, slaves were transported together with guineafowl and passwords were created 
                            by traffickers (Portuguese: "Tem galinha nova no porto"—"There are new chickens in the port"), 
                            hence the origin of the name.</p>
                        <h3 class="subTitleItem">Description</h3>
                        <p class="aboutBeaches">It has been voted "Best Brazilian Beach" for the eighth time in a row by the readers of Voyage & Tourism
                            Brazilian magazine. According to this magazine, the main reasons given are the beauty of the natural 
                            pools (the closest to the coast in all of Brazil), the ecological trails, the hotel infrastructure and
                            the proximity to a large city and the airport in Recife.</p>

                        <p class="aboutBeaches">Porto da Barra Beach is located in Barra neighborhood in the city of Salvador, 
                            Brazil. It is located at the entrance of the Baía de Todos os Santos (Bay of All Saints), is 300 metres 
                            (980 ft), and ranges between numerous Portuguese colonial-period military fortifications. 
                            The southern range of the beach is on a slope just above of the Barra Lighthouse at Santo Antônio da 
                            Barra Fort; the northern range of the beach is at São Diogo Fort. The Santa Maria Fort extends from a 
                            point near the southern end of the beach. The beach, unlike the bay, has calm water. It is one of the 
                            few west-facing beaches in Brazil and attracts numerous residents and tourists to watch the sunset. <br>
                            <br>
                            Porto da Barra was the site of Bahia's first European settlement, Vila Velha, or the Old Village. The 
                            Marco da Fundação da Cidade do Salvador, a marble column and panel of azulejo tiles, was placed at the 
                            north of the beach to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the Portuguese in Bahia.<br>
                            <br>
                            The beach was a popular hangout for the Tropicalistas in the 1960s, notably Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. 
                            Veloso's song Qual é Baiana? is inspired by the beach.<br>
                            <br>
                            The Porto da Barra Beach suffers from marine pollution due to the underdeveloped sewage system of Salvador and 
                            inadequate garbage collection.

                        <p class="aboutBeaches">Jericoacoara is a virgin beach hidden behind the dunes of the west coast of Jijoca de 
                            Jericoacoara, Ceará, Brazil. Selected by The Washington Post as one of the Top 10 most beautiful beaches in the 
                            world, "Jeri" consists of blue lagoons, calm seas and huge dunes.</p> 
                        <h3 class="subTitleItem">Etymology</h3>
                        <p class="aboutBeaches">In 1984, the area around Jericoacoara was declared an environmental protection area. 
                            It became national park in 2002. As a result, many restrictions on building and tourism were introduced
                            to help preserve the area. The distance to bigger cities and limited road access also helped to keep 
                            the beach and the village isolated.<br>
                            <br>
                            Fairly recently, Jeri was just a fishing village with little contact with modern life. Electricity 
                            was generated by diesel engines, and street lighting was provided only by the moon and the stars. 
                            After the selection by The Washington Post was published, tourism grew rapidly, and the beach village 
                            became a popular destination. Electricity arrived in 1998, and today hot showers and air conditioning 
                            are no longer luxuries. However, electrical street illumination is still forbidden by local law.</p>
                        <h3 class="subTitleItem">Characteristics</h3>
                        <p class="aboutBeaches" >Getting to Jeri can still be challenging. The road from Fortaleza to Jericoacoara presents beaches and 
                            rustic villages. The last 4 hours of the journey takes place off-road, among dunes and along a beach. 
                            It is one of several places in Brazil from which one can see the sun sink into the ocean. Both visitors
                            and locals often view this show from the tall "sunset dune" just next to the village.<br>
                            <br>
                            The village has streets covered in sand from the dunes. Jericoacoara is a popular spot for windsurfing 
                            and sailing.</p>
